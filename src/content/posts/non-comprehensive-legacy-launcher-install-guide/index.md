I'll try to guide you through properly installing and setting up legacy launcher, and installing FO (Fabulously Optimized) for any version.

I'll be using a Virtual Machine to demonstrate the install from scratch

## Installing the launcher

Head over to [tlaun.ch](https://tlaun.ch) and click on Download for windows

As per mojangs requests, the download has been disabled in some countries. in that case you may use a VPN or a mirror download

after downloading, launch LegacyLauncher\_Installer\_legacy.exe and select your language, and click on next a couple of times, and then click install. if you want to, you can change the installation location to somewhere more accessible.

Uncheck Experimental, Show old releases, and Snapshots.

Click save and return home

## Installing minecraft

for this guide, ill install minecraft version 1.21

![](https://blogtrimpta.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-9.png?w=1024)

Since we're installing 1.21, click on Fabric 1.21, and Install and play.

You might have to wait 5-20 minutes depending on your internet connection.

After its Downloaded, Minecraft should launch automatically, but if it doesn't, Click on Enter the game.

Once the game is loaded, you can close it(sorry, you have to wait just a bit longer to play the game)

## Installing Fabulously Optimized

This is what'll take your FPS from 40 to 200  

![](https://blogtrimpta.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10.png?w=1024)

After making sure minecraft is closed, Click on the folder icon, and Open Fabric-1.21 Folder

Head over to [https://download.fo/vanilla](https://download.fo/vanilla) and select the version you're playing on, and hit the download button.

after its downloaded, move the zip file to the minecraft folder we just opened.

Right click on the zip file, and select extract archive.

![](https://blogtrimpta.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11.png?w=768)

The path will be in the format ...\\.minecraft\\home\\Fabric 1.21**\\Fabulously Optimized-6.0.0-beta.6**

remove everything after the last "\\"(The underlined part) so it looks like this

![](https://blogtrimpta.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12.png?w=768)

Now you can delete the zip file from your minecraft folder.

You can now launch minecraft, and accept any prompts that come up
