The last two years I have been making various little python scripts, learning a lot of things along the way, but now I feel like it's time to take my learning to a new level, and do things I always wanted to do

## What will I learn?

I have set my goals high, but I think it's possible. even if I don't finish, who cares? I will still have learnt a lot, and be a thousand steps ahead of where I am right now.

- Flask, Django, API Design, Database, Scaling

- Python - More libraries (Selenium, Tesseract, numpy, pandas, pygame, Manim.... the list goes on and on)

- HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Tailwind, React, Svelte, etc etc

- One or more programming languages

- Linux, Git, Docker, VMS, K8s, AWS, Firebase

- Networking(computers), Networking(people)

## My plan

That's a lotta stuff I chose to burden myself with. I plan to continue doing what I was already doing, and building tools to help automate tasks, and spend 3 days building something to save me 5 seconds a day.

I have already started building the [frontend](https://milktrack.netlify.app/) for my very first full stack web app, and I'm writing JS code without knowing a thing about js

With this one project, I hope to learn basic HTML, CSS, JS and some Flask for the backend. I hope to learn a lot of related skills like git, Databases, networking etc with this project, and provide me the footing to learn more.

## Why am I doing this?

idk i like programming v much next heading

## Thank you for reading
